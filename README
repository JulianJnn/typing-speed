This is a typing speed test made in Python. Once you execute the main file, a window containing a list of words will appear.

The timer starts once the user starts typing in the empty field, and each word is counted once the spacebar is hit.

At the end of the countdown, the user typing speed is calculated (in WPM and CPM).

You can click the "Restart" button anytime to try again.

The list contains only words that are commonly used in the English language.
